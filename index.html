					<p>After the the pandemic started I found myself with a lot of time on my hands so I thought why not do something productive with it and so the idea of learning to code and learning spanish was born. Want to feel stupid? Try learning them two new skills together! There have been a few of the usual false starts and situations which I think all self taught developers find themselves in, doing a lot of reading about coding without doing any actual coding, jumping from one course to another and trying to learn python on an ipad being three of the most painful.</p>
					<p>It has taken me longer than I thought to get to this point. I have learned a lot of lessons, sometimes the hard way but I finally feel that I have aquired the skills to land that all important first junior dev position and continue down this never ending rabbit whole that is learning how to code.</p>
